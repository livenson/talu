# Operations & runbooks

Runbooks for the things the cluster cannot rebuild itself from — the out-of-cluster survival
kit — and for single-node incidents.

**Available today:**

- **[`node-maintenance.md`](node-maintenance.md)** — take a node out of / back into service and do
  **rolling Talos / Kubernetes upgrades**, **live-migrating each node's VMs off first** (KubeVirt
  `evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate` + the `kubevirt.io/drain` taint). `make node-drain` / `node-uncordon`
  / `talos-upgrade` (dry-run by default). Single-node lab caveat: it refuses to evacuate (nowhere to
  migrate) rather than powering VMs off.
- **[`rotation.md`](rotation.md)** — rotating the **SSH User CA** (dual-trust, zero lockout, via the
  `talu-ca-trust` package — the platform never SSHes into guests) with `dev/lab/ca-rotate.sh`, plus
  platform-secret rotation (`secret-rotate.sh`) and the cert-manager auto-renewal note.
- **[`packages.md`](packages.md)** — how cluster-specific config reaches guests as **OS packages**:
  build → flat apt repo → the in-cluster `pkg-repo` → mutable-guest auto-update (or baked into bootc
  images). Validated end-to-end (install + reboot-less v1→v2 upgrade).
- **[`backup-restore.md`](backup-restore.md)** — the three backup tiers (Talos etcd snapshot ·
  KubeVirt `VirtualMachineSnapshot` · Velero + file-system backup to S3/MinIO) with **explicit
  backup and restore flows**, validated end-to-end on the lab including a destroy-and-restore that
  recovered volume **data**. Read the `hostPath`/`local-path` gotcha before trusting a backup.
- **Host lockout recovery** (the Docker/network/MTU lockout): the failure mode and the
  cloud-console recovery are documented in
  [`../development/lab-notes.md`](../development/lab-notes.md) gotcha #1 — host MTU must be 1400
  before any container engine, or PMTU blackholes the SSH key exchange and locks out all SSH.
  Recover via `ip link set <iface> mtu 1400` from the provider console.
- **Full/crashed Ceph OSDs** (`bluefs enospc` → OSDs won't boot → CephFS provisioning hangs): the
  non-destructive `bluefs-bdev-expand` recovery is
  [`../development/lab-notes.md`](../development/lab-notes.md) gotcha #26.

**Planned** (added as the components they cover land):

- `ceph-recovery.md` — MON/OSD loss, `size 2` single-node caveats, re-add and rebalance
  (production Rook; the lab uses external MicroCeph — see `../../dev/lab/microceph-setup.sh`).
  The full-OSD case is already covered by lab-notes #26 (above).
- Promote Velero + MinIO from the lab install into `components/platform/backup/` so Tier 3 is
  part of the product, not a manual step.
